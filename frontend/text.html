INTRODUCTION

E-commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. More and more business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is becoming commonplace.
The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store where any kind of product can be brought from the comfort of home through the Internet. However, for implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online shopping for baby product. This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive e-commerce platform that allows customers to browse, select, and purchase a variety of products online, offering convenience and accessibility from any location.












PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

There are a lot of websites on internet whereby it offer a variety of product and services for consumer can find and buy through online such as shoe, jeans and more. Moreover, the online also provides some of the services which is paying bill online, booking a transport ticket and more. In this research, we are looking the problem addressed in this research which is the view of online shopping by consumer.
However, there are several reason hinder in the consumer are involved in online shopping because some of the consumer are not willing to take part in online purchased due to the valid reason because there are worried about the quality of the product in online are not durable, moreover, there are not confident. In addition, in this study also understand the influences of the social factors toward to purchase intension of consumers in online shopping and also study the attitude of the consumers purchase intention in online shopping.

















EXISTING SYSTEM

The current system for shopping is to visit the shop manually and from the available product choose the item customer want and buying the item by payment of the price of the item.
1.	It is less user-friendly.
2.	User must go to shop and select products.
3.	It is difficult to identify the required product.
4.	Description of the product limited.
5.	It is a time consuming process.
6.	Not in reach of distant users.

















Proposed System
The proposed system is a general-purpose e-commerce platform that enables users to shop for a variety of products online with ease and security. The application is built to provide a smooth, responsive, and user-friendly experience across all devices. The core functionalities of the system are as follows:

 Product Browsing:
Users can explore a wide range of products organized by categories. Each product includes essential details such as images, descriptions, and pricing.
 Add to Cart:
Customers can add products to their cart and review them before finalizing their purchase. Items in the cart are retained during the session for convenience.
 Wishlist:
The platform allows users to save products in their wishlist for future reference or purchase. This enhances user convenience and retention.
 Login and Signup (JWT Authentication):
The system uses secure JWT-based authentication for user login and registration. Authenticated users can manage their accounts, view orders, and save preferences.
 Newsletter Signup:
Users can subscribe to the store's newsletter by entering their email address to receive regular updates on discounts, new arrivals, and promotions.
 Contact Form:
A contact form is provided for users to reach out with inquiries, feedback, or support requests. Submissions are handled by the admin or support team.
 Checkout Process:
Once users proceed to checkout, they can enter shipping details and make payments through a secure payment gateway, completing the order seamlessly.




















FEASIBILITY STUDY
Feasibility is an important phase in the software development process it enables the developers to have an assessment of the project being developed it refers to the feasibility study of the project in terms of outcomes of the product, operational required for implementing it. Feasibility study should be performed on the basis of various criteria and parameters. The various feasibility studies are:-
•	Economic Feasibility
•	Operational Feasibility
•	Technical Feasibility
Economic Feasibility :-
It refers to the benefits or outcomes we are deriving from the product as compared to the total cost we are spending for developing the benefits are more or less the same as the older system then it is not feasible to develop the product.
The product is economical feasible. The E-governance provides the following benefits to primary school.
•	Reduce the processing time
•	Reduces the work load
•	Administrative will be effective
Operational Feasibility :-
It refers to the feasibility of the product to be operational. Some products may work very well at the design  and implementation but many fail in the real time environment. It introduces the study of human resources required and their technical expertise.
               This product is operationally feasible as it is designed specially for E-Governance. This provides consistent and integrated data management. It also provides information at all levels of people.
Technical Feasibility :-
The system is self-explanting and does not need any entire sophisticated training. A system has been built by concentrating on the graphical uses interface concepts, the application can also be handled very easily with a novice uses. The overall time that a user needs to get trained is less than 15 minutes.
                The system has been added with features of menu device and button interaction methods, which makes him the master as he starts working through the environment. As the software that were used as developing this application are very economical and are readily available is the market the only time that is lost by the customer is just installation time.
